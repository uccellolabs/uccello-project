**Uccello** is based on the Laravel Framework and can be easily added to an existing Laravel project. It is thus possible to easily add a complete **back-office** to manage the data of a website. Or you may prefer to develop a customized management **application** or **CRM** to improve your company's productivity? Uccello was also designed for this purpose!

This package is a **pre-configured version** of Uccello.
